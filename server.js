        author: "Jacques Derrida", 
        content: `"Nothing is less reliable, nothing is less clear today than the word 'archive.' We do not know what this word responds to, what it promises or threatens. As it is often the case, the trouble comes from the complication of a consignation in Greek: arkhƒì. In a context that concerns nothing less than the archive, and which will concern us later on, we will have to remember that the meaning of 'arkhƒì' is also 'commencement' and 'commandment.'"\n\nThis word names at once the commencement and the commandment. Its name coordinates two principles in one: the principle according to nature or history, there where things commence‚Äîphysical, historical, or ontological principle‚Äîbut also the principle according to the law, there where men and gods command, there where authority, social order are exercised, in this place from which order is given‚Äînomological principle.\n\nThe archivable meaning is to be found neither in the stored object nor in the act of storing, but precisely in the spacing between them. The archive takes place at the place of originary and structural breakdown of the said memory. There is no archive without a place of consignation, without a technique of repetition, and without a certain exteriority. No archive without outside.\n\nArchive fever is not only a disease, it is also that which conditions the possibility of archiving itself. It is burning with passion. It is never to rest, interminably, from searching for the archive right where it slips away. It is to run after the archive, even and especially when there is too much of it, when something in it anarchives itself, destroys itself, devours itself.\n\nThe question of the archive is not a question of the past. It is a question of the future, the question of the future itself, the question of a response, of a promise and of a responsibility for tomorrow. The archive: if we want to know what that will have meant, we will only know in times to come."`,

        author: "Martin Heidegger",
        content: `"What calls for thinking? The question sounds like one that asks for information, as if we were asking: What calls for help? Or: What calls for action in this emergency? But the question 'What calls for thinking?' asks for something that concerns us directly, here and now.\n\nMost thought-provoking in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking. This is why the question 'What calls for thinking?' is the most thought-provoking question we can ask. It is more thought-provoking than any problem posed by a particular science as a problem within its special sphere.\n\n'What calls for thinking?' can mean: what is it that calls on us to think? But it can also mean: what is it that calls us into thinking? In the first case we ask what it is that summons us to think. In the second case we ask toward what we are called when we think.\n\nTo think is to confine yourself to a single thought that one day stands still like a star in the world's sky. The nature of thinking is determined by what there is to be thought about. What gives us the right to characterize something as thought-provoking?\n\nWe come to know what it means to think when we ourselves try to think. If the attempt is to be successful, we must be ready to learn thinking. As soon as we allow ourselves to become involved in such learning we have admitted that we are not yet capable of thinking.\n\nYet man can think in the sense that he possesses the possibility to do so. This possibility alone, however, is no guarantee that we are capable of thinking. For it may be that man can think, but nonetheless cannot think unless... unless what? Unless he learns to dwell."`,

        title: "The Computer and the Brain",
        author: "John von Neumann",
        content: `"The human nervous system is, among all systems, the most complicated one known to us. Its macroscopic aspects are evident: It contains about 10^10 neurons, each of which is connected to about 10^4 others. It is therefore characterized by 10^14 connections. Each connection is capable of transmitting about one impulse per millisecond, so that the information flow in the system is about 10^17 impulses per second.\n\nThe most immediate observation regarding the nervous system is that its functioning is prima facie digital. A neuron receives inputs from other neurons, and after suitable stimulation it emits an output. The all-or-none character of this functioning is primarily what suggests a digital procedure.\n\nHowever, the actual nature of the nervous system's digital operations appears to be quite different from those of modern computing machines. The difference is both in the principles of operation and in the constructional details.\n\nThe nervous system is characterized by the following features: First, it is very slow compared to modern electronic devices. Second, it has enormous parallelism. Third, it has a very different logical structure from current computing machines.\n\nIn the human brain, the all-or-none principle of neural operation may be misleading. There are many phenomena which suggest that the neuron may be a more complex logical unit than has generally been believed. The threshold concept may be an oversimplification.\n\nThe brain, under normal circumstances, is not subject to error in the same sense as a computing machine. However, it is continuously exposed to destruction and errors of individual components. Nevertheless, the organism functions effectively as long as the damage does not exceed certain limits.\n\nThe question is: How can reliable function be achieved with unreliable components? This suggests that the logical organization of the brain may be fundamentally different from that of artificial computing machines."`,
