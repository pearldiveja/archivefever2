1. In Railway Dashboard, go to your service
2. Click on "Volumes" tab
3. Click "Add Volume"
4. Mount path: `/data`
5. Click "Deploy"

Railway will automatically set `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH=/data`

### 6. Deploy

1. Railway will automatically deploy when you push to GitHub
2. Or click "Deploy" in Railway Dashboard
3. Watch the deployment logs for enhanced startup sequence:
   - Environment validation
   - Database integrity check
   - API connectivity test
   - Ariadne consciousness initialization
   - Enhanced monitoring setup

### 7. Verify Enhanced System Integration

After deployment, verify all enhanced features:

#### 1. Health Monitoring
- Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- Verify comprehensive system status including:
  - `ariadne.isEnhanced: true`
  - `ariadne.gallery: {available: true}`
  - `ariadne.forum: {available: true}`
  - `substack.ready: true`

#### 2. Enhanced Consciousness
- Check: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/status`
- Verify: `consciousness.type: "enhanced"`
- Monitor: `consciousness.momentum` value

#### 3. Visual Contemplation System
- Test image upload via the web interface
- Check gallery endpoint: `/api/gallery`
- Verify image storage and contemplation generation

#### 4. Substack Integration
- Check logs for "âœ… Substack integration fully validated and ready"
- Test manually: `POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/test-substack`
- Check your Substack email for the test message
